---

### 1. What is the MERN Stack?
**Answer:** MERN Stack is a full-stack JavaScript framework using MongoDB (database), Express.js (backend framework), React (frontend library), and Node.js (server runtime). Itâ€™s popular for building fast, scalable web apps with one languageâ€”JavaScript.

### 2. What is MongoDB, and why use it in MERN?
**Answer:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Itâ€™s used in MERN because itâ€™s scalable, easy to integrate with JavaScript, and great for handling unstructured data.

### 3. How does Express.js work in the MERN Stack?
**Answer:** Express.js is a lightweight framework for Node.js that handles server-side logic, like routing and APIs. In MERN, it connects React to MongoDB by managing HTTP requests.

### 4. What is React, and what makes it special?
**Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s special because it uses a virtual DOM for fast updates and reusable components for easier coding.

### 5. What is Node.js, and why is it important in MERN?
**Answer:** Node.js is a runtime that lets you run JavaScript on the server. In MERN, it powers the backend, making the stack fully JavaScript-based.

### 6. Whatâ€™s the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
**Answer:** SQL uses fixed tables (e.g., MySQL), while NoSQL (like MongoDB) uses flexible documents or key-value pairs, ideal for dynamic data in MERN apps.

### 7. How do you install the MERN Stack?
**Answer:** Install Node.js (includes npm), then use:
- `npm install express` for Express  
- `npx create-react-app` for React  
- Install MongoDB via its site or use Mongoose (`npm install mongoose`)

### 8. What are React components?
**Answer:** Components are reusable building blocks in React, like functions or classes, that return UI elements. Example: a button or a navbar.

### 9. Whatâ€™s the virtual DOM in React?
**Answer:** Itâ€™s a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates it first, compares changes, and only updates the real DOM where neededâ€”makes it fast!

### 10. What are hooks in React?
**Answer:** Hooks are functions (like `useState`, `useEffect`) that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

### 11. How do you manage state in React?
**Answer:** Use `useState` for local state, Context API for global state, or Redux for complex state management.

### 12. Whatâ€™s Redux, and when do you use it?
**Answer:** Redux is a state management library. Use it in large apps where multiple components need access to shared data.

### 13. Whatâ€™s the event loop in Node.js?
**Answer:** It handles asynchronous tasks in Nodeâ€™s single-threaded environment by processing events and callbacks in a loop.

### 14. How do you create an API in Express.js?
**Answer:** Example:
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

### 15. Whatâ€™s middleware in Express.js?  
**Answer:** Middleware are functions that run between the request and response cycle in Express. Theyâ€™re useful for logging, authentication, error handling, etc.

### 16. How do you connect MongoDB to Node.js?  
**Answer:** Use Mongoose to connect:  
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/dbname');

### 17. Whatâ€™s a schema in MongoDB?  
**Answer:** A schema defines the structure of documents in a collection. In Mongoose, it's written as a JavaScript object.

### 18. How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB using Mongoose?
**Answer:**
- **Create:** `Model.create()`  
- **Read:** `Model.find()`  
- **Update:** `Model.updateOne()`  
- **Delete:** `Model.deleteOne()`

### 19. Whatâ€™s JWT, and how do you use it in MERN?
**Answer:**  
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication. After login, a token is created and used to protect routes by verifying it in middleware.

### 20. How do you handle errors in Express.js?
**Answer:**  
Use error-handling middleware like this:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
});

### 21. Whatâ€™s the difference between props and state in React?
**Answer:**  : Props are read-only and passed to components. State is mutable and controlled inside the component.

### 22. How do you fetch data in React?
**Answer:**: Use useEffect with fetch or axios:
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api').then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
}, []);

### 23. Whatâ€™s a RESTful API?
**Answer:**: An API design style that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage data resources.

### 24. How do you secure a MERN app?
**Answer:**: Use HTTPS, JWT for authentication, helmet for security headers, input sanitization, and bcrypt for password hashing.

### 25. Whatâ€™s the difference between let, const, and var?
**Answer:**:
var: function-scoped, hoisted
let: block-scoped, can be reassigned
const: block-scoped, cannot be reassigned

### 26. How do you optimize React performance?
**Answer:**: Use React.memo, useMemo, lazy loading (React.lazy), and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 27. Whatâ€™s CORS, and how do you handle it in Express?
**Answer:**: CORS allows cross-origin requests. Use the cors package in Express:
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());

### 28. Whatâ€™s the purpose of package.json in Node.js?
**Answer:**: It holds project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configurations.

### 29. How do you handle async operations in Node.js?
**Answer:**: Use callbacks, Promises, or async/await. Example:
const data = await fetchData();

### 30. Whatâ€™s indexing in MongoDB?
**Answer:**: Indexing improves search performance. Example:
db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 });

### 31. How do you deploy a MERN app?
**Answer:**: Build React (npm run build), serve via Express, deploy backend to Vercel/Heroku, and use MongoDB Atlas.

### 32. Whatâ€™s server-side rendering (SSR) in React?
**Answer:**: SSR renders components on the server and sends HTML to the browser for better SEO and faster load.

### 33. How do you implement WebSockets in MERN?
**Answer:**: Use Socket.IO on both client and server for real-time communication.

### 34. Whatâ€™s the difference between map() and forEach() in JavaScript?
**Answer:**: map() returns a new array with transformed values; forEach() just iterates without returning.

### 35. How do you test a React component?
**Answer:**: Use Jest + React Testing Library:
render(<Component />);
expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();

### 36. Whatâ€™s Mongoose in MERN?
**Answer:**: Mongoose is an ODM that simplifies working with MongoDB using models, schemas, and validation.

### 37. Whatâ€™s prop drilling in React?
**Answer:**: Passing props through many component levels. Use Context API or Redux to avoid it.

### 38. How do you handle file uploads in MERN?
**Answer:**: Use multer in Express:
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => { ... });

### 39. Whatâ€™s the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
**Answer:**: useEffect runs after DOM painting, useLayoutEffect runs before paintâ€”useful for measurements and layout updates.

### 40. How do you scale a MERN app?
**Answer:**: Use horizontal scaling, caching (Redis), load balancers, and optimize queries and assets.

### 41. Whatâ€™s GraphQL, and can it replace REST in MERN?
**Answer:**: GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It allows fetching only required data and can replace REST for more flexible APIs.

### 42. How do you debug a MERN app?
**Answer:**: Use console.log, Chrome DevTools, Nodeâ€™s --inspect flag, and Postman for API testing.

### 43. Whatâ€™s a higher-order component (HOC) in React?
**Answer:**: An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added features.

### 44. How do you handle variables in MERN?
**Answer:**: Store variables in a .env file and load using dotenv:
require('dotenv').config();

### 45. Whatâ€™s lazy loading in React?
**Answer:**: Components are loaded only when needed using React.lazy() for performance optimization.

### 46. How do you write unit tests for Node.js?
**Answer:**: Use Jest or Mocha + Chai:
test('adds numbers', () => {
  expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});

### 47. Whatâ€™s the aggregation framework in MongoDB?
**Answer:**: A powerful data-processing pipeline to group, filter, and transform documents like SQLâ€™s GROUP BY.

### 48. How do you prevent SQL injection in MongoDB?
**Answer:**: MongoDB doesnâ€™t use SQL, but always sanitize inputs using express-validator or similar libraries.

### 49. Whatâ€™s the difference between SSR and CSR?
**Answer:**: SSR: server-side rendering, better for SEO and load time
CSR: client-side rendering, better for dynamic user interaction

### 50. How do you stay updated with MERN trends?
